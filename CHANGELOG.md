# Changelog

All notable changes to `packstub/filament-kanban` are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- Per-card rules: `Card::locked()` (or `draggable(false)`) keeps one card where it is. The browser skips the drag and the "Move to" menu and shows a lock before the title; the server reads the card again on every move and refuses with "This card cannot be moved.", for a reorder inside the column too (#2).
- `Card::description()`: a muted line under the title, clamped to two lines (#3).
- `Card::progress($done, $total)` or `progress($fraction)`: a thin bar at the bottom of the card, `3/5` on hover, green when full (#3).
- `Card::due($date, $label = null)`: a date with a calendar glyph, red once past and amber on the day, decided in the viewer's time zone; the label defaults to `config('app.date_format')` or `M j` (#3).
- `Card::badge(..., icon: 'heroicon-m-phone')`: a Heroicon before a badge's label (#3).
- `Column::icon()` next to the colour dot and `Column::description()` as a tooltip on the header (#3).
- Fixed: an `Htmlable` column label (`new HtmlString('…')`) is drawn as HTML in the header and the menus instead of showing its markup escaped; plain strings are still escaped. `Column::label()` also accepts an `Htmlable` directly.
- The instant search also matches a card's description and due label.
- Fixed: a move refused by a `MoveRejected` still shows its message; any other exception thrown while saving (the database's, `moveUsing()`'s) is reported to the exception handler and answered with "The move did not go through." instead of its text, so a query with its bindings never reaches a notification. `Board::move()` lets such an exception propagate. Throw `MoveRejected` from `moveUsing()` for a message the user should see.
- Fixed: the board no longer flashes unstyled on page load (a search icon the width of the page) before its stylesheet, loaded on request, applies; it stays hidden until then.
- Fixed: a horizontal swipe over a column scrolls the board; the card list no longer captures the gesture (it scrolls vertically only, without overscroll containment), so a short column also lets the page scroll past it.
- Docs: a shorter Features list in the README and on the docs index, one line per area.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-30

- Card actions: any Filament action (`EditAction`, `DeleteAction`, your own) in each card's menu, on the card's record, resolved through the board's query. `cardAction('edit')` runs one when the card is clicked, in a modal or a slide-over; `Card::actions([...])` narrows the list per card. The board refreshes after an action. Components without Filament's action system (`HasActions`) get no card or create actions.
- Create in a column: `createAction(CreateAction::make()->schema([...]))` puts a "+" on every droppable column and sets the column attribute on the new record. `Column::creatable(false)` leaves a column out; the server refuses hidden, read-only and full columns.
- Enum columns: `columns(Status::class)` or `Column::fromEnum()` makes one column per case, with labels and colours from `HasLabel` and `HasColor`.
- WIP limits: `Column::limit(5)` shows `3/5` in the header and refuses moves and new cards once the column is full, on the server as well.
- Column summaries: `summarize(fn (Builder $query) => ...)` puts a line (a sum, an average) under each column title, kept current after every move.
- Polling: `poll('10s')` picks up other people's changes while nobody is dragging. A poll, like the refresh after an action, keeps the cards already loaded with "Load more".
- `CardMoved` event (`Packstub\Kanban\Events\CardMoved`) after a card changes column, and a `kanban-card-moved` browser event.
- `Card::avatar($url, $name)`: owners and assignees in the card's foot, initials when there is no picture.
- "Load more" loads by itself when it scrolls into view.
- The instant search also matches the names on a card's avatars.
- Fixed: Alpine no longer evaluates the dragged card's copy (Sortable's ghost), which logged "card is not defined" errors on every drag.
- Fixed: the dragged card keeps its background, fonts and dark-mode colours (the ghost lives outside the board).

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-30

First public preview. The API may still change before 1.0.

- First release: `Board`, `Column`, `Card`, `Filter`; `KanbanPage` and `KanbanResourcePage`; the `InteractsWithKanban` trait for any Livewire component.
- Optimistic drag and drop on Filament's SortableJS, with server-enforced column rules (`visible`, `accepts`, `droppable`, `draggable`) and roll-back with the reason when a move is refused.
- Instant in-browser search refined by the server, select filters, paging per column, "Move to…" menu, folding and hiding columns remembered per user, focus mode without the sidebar.
- Translations: en, ro, ru, de.
